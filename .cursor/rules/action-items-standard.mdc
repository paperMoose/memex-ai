# Action Items Standard Format

## Purpose
Standardize action items across all CRM files to enable automatic extraction, tracking, and prioritization.

## Where Action Items Belong

**Action items should ONLY exist in:**
- `/active_leads/` - For potential opportunities in the pipeline
- `/projects/` - For confirmed work and active engagements

**Action items should NEVER exist in:**
- `/people/` - People files document relationships, not tasks. If you need to do something involving a person, create or reference a lead/project file instead.

**Why this separation?**
- **People files** are permanent relationship records (who they are, how you met, interactions)
- **Leads/Projects** are temporary work items that get archived when complete
- This keeps your active task list focused and prevents stale action items from cluttering people files

## Standard Format

**REQUIRED FORMAT** - All action items MUST follow this exact structure:

```markdown
- [ ] **PRIORITY:** Task description *(added YYYY-MM-DD)*
```

### Priority Levels (REQUIRED)
- `**URGENT:**` - Within 24 hours
- `**HIGH:**` - Within week
- `**MEDIUM:**` - Default priority (still must be explicit)
- `**LOW:**` - When time permits

### Date Tag (REQUIRED)
- `*(added YYYY-MM-DD)*` - When item was created
- `*(moved from YYYY-MM-DD)*` - When item was moved from another file

### Complete Examples
```markdown
- [ ] **URGENT:** Respond to client's email about partnership proposal *(added 2025-11-13)*
- [ ] **HIGH:** Follow up on coffee meeting from Nov 10 *(added 2025-11-13)*
- [ ] **MEDIUM:** Schedule Q1 2026 check-in call *(added 2025-11-08)*
- [ ] **LOW:** Research competitor pricing *(added 2025-11-12)*
- [ ] **HIGH:** Task moved from last week *(moved from 2025-11-06)*
```

### ❌ INVALID FORMATS (Do Not Use)
```markdown
- [ ] Task without priority or date
- [ ] Task with date only *(added 2025-11-13)*
- [ ] **HIGH:** Task with priority only
- [ ] 🔴 Task with emoji instead of text priority *(added 2025-11-13)*
- [ ] URGENT: Task with unbolded priority *(added 2025-11-13)*
```

---

## Where to Place Action Items

**CRITICAL RULE:** Action items belong ONLY in `/active_leads/` and `/projects/` files.

**❌ NEVER place action items in `/people/` files.** People files document relationships and interactions, not tasks.

### In Project Files
Place under `## Action Items` section after status and overview:

```markdown
## Status
- **Current Status:** In Progress
- **Next Milestone:** Complete Phase 1
- **Last Updated:** 2025-11-13

## Overview
[project details]

## Action Items
- [ ] **URGENT:** Finalize proposal document
- [ ] Review technical specifications
- [ ] Schedule kickoff meeting
```

### In Lead Files
Place under `## Action Items` section after status and meeting notes:

```markdown
## Status
- **Stage:** Proposal Sent
- **Next Step:** Follow up on proposal
- **Last Updated:** 2025-11-13

## Action Items
- [ ] Follow up in 3 days if no response
- [ ] Prepare pricing alternatives
```

### In Task Context Files
Place under `## Completion Criteria` as deliverables:

```markdown
## Completion Criteria
- [ ] Deliverable 1 *(added 2025-11-13, from update 2025-11-13)*
- [ ] Deliverable 2 *(added 2025-11-13, from update 2025-11-13)*
```

## Priority Levels

### 🔴 URGENT (Priority 1)
- Requires immediate attention (within 24 hours)
- Blocking other work
- Has external deadline
- Client-facing and time-sensitive

**Keywords:** URGENT, ASAP, CRITICAL, BLOCKER

### 🟡 HIGH (Priority 2)
- Important but not immediate (within week)
- Key business relationships
- Revenue-generating activities
- Strategic opportunities

**Keywords:** HIGH, IMPORTANT, PRIORITY

### 🟢 MEDIUM (Priority 3)
- Standard work items
- Regular follow-ups
- General maintenance tasks
- Default priority level

**Keyword REQUIRED:** `**MEDIUM:**` (must be explicit, no defaults)

### ⚪ LOW (Priority 4)
- Nice to have
- Can be deferred
- Low impact if delayed
- Background tasks

**Keywords:** LOW, NICE-TO-HAVE, OPTIONAL, WHEN-TIME-PERMITS

## Best Practices

### DO ✅
- [ ] **Be specific:** "Call John about Q1 project pricing" not "Follow up with John"
- [ ] **ALWAYS add priority:** Use `**URGENT:**`, `**HIGH:**`, `**MEDIUM:**`, or `**LOW:**`
- [ ] **ALWAYS add date:** Include `*(added YYYY-MM-DD)*` when creating
- [ ] **One action per line:** Don't combine multiple actions
- [ ] **Use consistent sections:** Always place under `## Action Items` heading
- [ ] **Link references:** Use `[file](mdc:path/to/file.md)` for task context files
- [ ] **Follow exact format:** `- [ ] **PRIORITY:** Task *(added YYYY-MM-DD)*`
- [ ] **Place in correct files:** ONLY in `/active_leads/` or `/projects/` files, NEVER in `/people/` files

### DON'T ❌
- [ ] ~~Vague actions~~ → "Do the thing" (too vague)
- [ ] ~~Multiple actions~~ → "Call John and email Sarah and book meeting" (split these)
- [ ] ~~No context~~ → Items without enough detail to execute
- [ ] ~~Scattered placement~~ → Action items placed randomly in file
- [ ] ~~Missing priority~~ → Every action item MUST have a priority marker
- [ ] ~~Missing date~~ → Every action item MUST have a date tag
- [ ] ~~Emoji priorities~~ → Use text (`**URGENT:**`) not emoji (🔴)
- [ ] ~~Unbolded priorities~~ → Must be `**URGENT:**` not `URGENT:`
- [ ] ~~Action items in people files~~ → People files are for relationship documentation, not tasks

## Automatic Updates

When the AI updates files:

1. **Adding new action items:** 
   - MUST include both `**PRIORITY:**` and `*(added YYYY-MM-DD)*`
   - Format: `- [ ] **PRIORITY:** Task description *(added YYYY-MM-DD)*`
2. **Moving to done:** Change `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
3. **Removing:** Delete line entirely (if no longer relevant)
4. **Deferring:** Move to new file with `*(moved from YYYY-MM-DD)*` tag
5. **Updating Last Updated field:** Always update file's `Last Updated` to current date when changing action items
6. **Fixing old action items:** Add missing priority/date tags to bring into compliance

---

## Examples by File Type

**Remember:** Action items ONLY belong in `/active_leads/` and `/projects/` files, NOT in `/people/` files.

### Project File Example
```markdown
# Project Name

## Status
- **Current Status:** In Progress
- **Next Milestone:** Phase 1 completion

## Action Items
- [ ] **URGENT:** Submit Phase 1 deliverables by Friday *(added 2025-11-13)*
- [ ] **HIGH:** Review client feedback on wireframes *(added 2025-11-12)*
- [ ] **MEDIUM:** Schedule Phase 2 kickoff for next week *(added 2025-11-11)*
- [ ] **LOW:** Update project timeline with revised dates *(added 2025-11-10)*
```

### Lead File Example
```markdown
# Acme Corp Lead

## Action Items
- [ ] **URGENT:** Respond to pricing questions by EOD *(added 2025-11-13)*

## Script Integration

The `action_items_report.py` script extracts these automatically:

```bash
# Show all action items across CRM
python3 scripts/action_items_report.py

# Show only urgent items
python3 scripts/action_items_report.py --priority URGENT

# Export as markdown
python3 scripts/action_items_report.py --format markdown --output action_items.md
```

The script automatically:
- Detects priority from keywords and emojis
- Extracts dates from `*(added YYYY-MM-DD)*` tags
- Finds context from section headers
- Sorts by priority and date
- Outputs with full file paths for easy navigation
